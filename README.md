Hey Day is a tradition at Auburn University which inlvolves the encourgement of wearing nametags and greeting others on campus. This tradition started in 1947 after WWII when students returning campus felt disconnected from the Auburn community. To remedy this, the Student Government Association passed out nametags and encouraged friendly interactions on campus. This became a beloved tradition at the school and is still practiced every year!
